					A Soulless Mind for a Mindless Soul

					In the recent months I've started to come to a realization that I could do something and become a part of something more.<br>
Looking into such realizations I wished to act upon them such that I would be included in a community of people with similar interests.<br>
Prior to such ambitions of mine, I've had a very logical mindset to which could not be detered to stay, <br>I was very brutally honest and kept to myself.<br>
When the time came, this mindset of mine had changed, for I had finally wanted change and got it.<br>
Though my new frame of mind had been vastly influenced by the group of people I was interested with and do care about, It was easily hidden by the fact of my own will.<br>
I had changed, and I am full of emotion,<br>and this was the result of what had occured.
				</p>

				<p class="body">
					Knowing that I have been in a dull state for a long time, longing for some excitement I seeked for, I kept pleading to my mind to find something worthwhile.<br>
Months of looking around, unsure of a community to be apart of, anxious of the outcomes, I was reluctant in practice.<br>
I knew that I would have to try something soon, but anxiety and pressure from the unknown fog of uncertainty has kept me in the bland darkness.<br>
Going from person to person, I just never seemed to feel comfortable fitting in.<br>
I just want to be myself,<br> but that's too much to ask in the judging eyes of the quiet crowd.<br>
				</p>

				<p class="body">
					Though with dull beginnings and uncertain fate, I sought to venture on a mindless trek, thinking to ignore the beration given by the generation.<br>
Drifting through empty space with an empty mindset like my surroundings, thinking that everything is just another equation with no meaning, I was waiting for an answer.<br>
I got the answer I was looking for when I lost all motivation to care, so I took upon the opportunity and started to get involved with a community that seemed so distant from me.<br>
A rush of happiness went through my head, I've never felt happier before, all the judgement was gone and I loved being involved without getting turned off from others.<br>
I found a place, a community to call my own unlike the judgemental classmates forced to be around me in a learning institution.<br>
A place where I can express myself, an enviornment to which I feel encouraged to grow in, unlike the shackles handed upon me in school, I finally felt comfortable.<br>
				</p>

				<p class="body">
					The encampment of belonging and happiness has settled in my mind, I have grown to a changed person in my mind, fighting for the feelings of others instead of the constant pursuit of meaningless facts.<br>
Through the new campain of happiness and goodwill that has been forged by a good surrounding community, I sought to expand it's influence,<br> and so I did.<br>
Everyone whom I have had contact in this community, It was my goal to make them happy and welcomed, making others happy made me happy.<br>
I strived to become a reminder to those around me that, they had great self worth, It made them happy and encouraged, and so I got joyous.<br>
Without the sudden turning points that had led me to the realization of change I would be far worse off than I was now.<br>
				</p>

				<p class="body">
					People early in my life have shunned me into embarrassment and painful slience, and It still affects me to this day.<br>
From the ashes of the early tormenters people would call my peers, I kept quiet from them, and it rubs off into the present, I have many friends in the community where I belong but people around me would never know otherwise.<br>
I am a completely different person when I am away from the judging eye of the general crowd, and I wish I could be the kind and helpful self I am to others in school<br>
Thanks to the recent events that changed me, I help people with their problems and find solutions with them, a good friend to me is priceless.<br>
I would branch out to the people physically around me, but I am forever scarred by the past and my anxiety holds me back. <br>
I will always fight against it, and maybe one day I'll overcome the restraints from helping the people around me. <br>
Because of the community I found I shall always try and strive to be someone who helps others and inspires others to be the best that they can be.
